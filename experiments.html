<!--
Past iterations of the class had more tags but we realized not all of them will fit into your portfolio site in a reasonable way, so we have significantly shrunk the number of elements expected for part 2. Nevertheless, for full credit create page 'experiments.html' showing proper use of the elements (6 elems * 2 pts = 12 pts total). To expedite grading and avoid delays, deploy this page in the same Netlify deployment as the section above, and use the exact name we gave.
